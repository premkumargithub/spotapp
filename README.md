# Spot Application #

Spot Application is a where Spot helps authorized personnel to look at employees and see who is sitting where and doing what, all on a single screen.

## Purpose

** As Scry Anlaytics  is expanding, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep a track of employees and their ongoing projects. Maintaining excel sheets for such purposes is becoming an inefficient task. To pep it up, Scry has come up with an idea of Spot (Scry +Bot), a quick and simple to use web platform.

Each route define a path (e.g. '/artists'), an HTTP method (e.g. 'GET'), an handler which receives the request's parameters or payload, that is often used to call a controller action (see /controllers directory) and a validation function possibly used to validate data received by an HTTP request, like PUT or POST
