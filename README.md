# Spot Application #

Spot Application is a where Spot helps authorized personnel to look at employees and see who is sitting where and doing what, all on a single screen.

## Purpose

** As Scry Anlaytics  is expanding, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep a track of employees and their ongoing projects.
