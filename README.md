# Spot Application #

Spot Application is a where Spot helps authorized personnel to look at employees and see who is sitting where and doing what, all on a single screen.

## Purpose

** As Scry Anlaytics  is expanding, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep a track of employees and their ongoing projects. Maintaining excel sheets for such purposes is becoming an inefficient task. To pep it up, Scry has come up with an idea of Spot (Scry +Bot), a quick and simple to use web platform.

## Short description of the repository structure

The url endpoints are defined on files inside the config directory (**config/**) among with other parameters used to establish connections.   
Each file represent a configuration that depends on the current environment (development, stage, production, ...).

**/routes** folder contains modules where all the routes exposed by the API server are defined. Each route define a path (e.g. '/artists'), an HTTP method (e.g. 'GET'), an handler which receives the request's parameters or payload, that is often used to call a controller action (see /controllers directory) and a validation function possibly used to validate data received by an HTTP request, like PUT or POST

**/controllers**Â contains the controllers that typically make DB queries and return the result to the client in JSON format

**/events** directory defines subscriptions following the pub/sub pattern.

**/helper** and **/libs** contains various utilities modules

**/mailer** contains utility modules to send emails

in **/models** are defined schema models that define the structure of a document that will be saved in the DB. Often controllers refer to a specific model to create and add a new entity to the DB, and also to verify that the entity is consistent with the DB schema

**/public** contains some static JSON files which are sometimes used directly as a response from a controller or used as a reference to get some parameters (e.g. currencies codes and symbols are stored in public/configs/currencies.json)

**/validations** are used to validate JSON objects against a schema (typically used by controllers to validate POST/PUT requests coming from a client)

**/workers** contains modules that are called every time the server starts, which initialize modules for statistics and to send email

**/runner** ?
